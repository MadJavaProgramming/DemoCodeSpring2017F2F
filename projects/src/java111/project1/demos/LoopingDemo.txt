Goal: Demonstrate looping using While and also 
        to demonstrate print vs. println
        
        Class name: LoopingDemo
        
        method: main will 
            - create a variable
            - assign value (a number)
            - use that variable in a while loop
            - print out the value of variable in the loop
            - demonstrate use of println versus print
